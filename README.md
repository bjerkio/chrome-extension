At [Bjerk], we're all about making your life better by changing the way we
think, learn, communicate, and work. We do this by making digital products. A
big part of this is making sure our users have a great experience, which can be
tough.

That's where our Chrome Extension comes in. It lets us test out new features
with some users, tell people about updates, and overall, make things better for
everyone. This tool helps us communicate with you, our team, and our
stakeholders more effectively. It's our way of making sure everyone has the best
experience possible.

## How to use it

Right now, we are [dogfooding] the application internally at Bjerk, and we only
support showing features. We hope to release it to a larger group soon! If you
still want to try it out, you can download the ZIP for our latest release and
run it using development mode in Chrome.
