[Bjerk] believes we can improve our lives by changing how we think, learn,
communicate and work, and currently, we do that by creating digital products. A
critical factor in this is user experience, which is hard. To improve the
experience, we sometimes need to experiment and show a subset of features and
communicate with our users, stakeholders, and our team.

Using a [Chrome Extension][chrome-ext] â€“ we can show features for a selection of
users, communicate about changes, and, most of all, create a better experience
for everyone.

## How to use it

Right now, we are [dogfooding] the application internally at Bjerk, and we only
support showing features. We hope to release it to a larger group soon! If you
still want to try it out, you can download the ZIP for our latest release and
run it using development mode in Chrome.
